I enjoy coding in R, Python, and bash.

### tracking software

I use OpenCV in Python to [track](https://github.com/lukereding/mateChoiceTracking) the fish in all my experiments. This makes data collection fast, repeatable, and precise.  

The graphic below represents ~3.5 million measurements of fish locations and heading angles for one of my experiments. Darker hexagons represent regions of the tank where the fish spent more time:

### Python video coder

I created a [GUI python program](https://github.com/lukereding/common_garden) for coding behavior data for an experiment in the Cummings lab. It allows the user to identify the location of different types of fish in a video and record the number and type of behaviors observed. I also wrote code in R that parses the resulting json data automatically creates various graphs of interest.

### graphics

I find myself dissatisfied with the plotting defaults and types of plots that can be produced with base R, so I created a [plotting package](https://github.com/lukereding/redingPlot) that implements (1) good defaults for various types of graphs and (2) adds new types of graphs with an emphasis on categorical x continuous data. See [here](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_graphics) for my thoughts and best practices for creating graphics.     
For ggplot2 users, you can find a clean theme and some nice color scales [here](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_graphics/blob/master/color_palettes.Rmd).

### analysis of RNA-seq data

I have some experience analyzing data from RNA-seq studies. See the code [here](https://github.com/lukereding/molly_arts).

### other code

I've written code to do various other tasks, like [coordinating two computers to show video on three-four screens simultaneously](https://github.com/lukereding/displaying_videos), [brew beer according to a precise temperature series](https://github.com/lukereding/brewing), [scramble video stimuli for use in behavior trials](https://github.com/lukereding/meghan_frog_videos) (see below), [and various other things](https://github.com/lukereding/meghan_frog_videos").
