I collect thoughts about visualizing data, communicating, teaching, and working with R in various GitHub repositories.

### models and guides

I try to embody _kaizen_ or continual improvements. As I read and observe things, I develop various mental models and guides for different situations: from thinking broadly about how approach a new problem to tactically how to run a meeting and manage a project. 

I keep a running list of these models and guides [here](https://github.com/lukereding/book_notes/tree/master/models_for) and [here](https://github.com/lukereding/book_notes/tree/master/guides_for).

### communicating science
Writing papers is tough but it’s the main vehicle for communicating science. [Here’s](https://github.com/lukereding/writing_tips/blob/master/writing_tips.md) a collection of tips, workflows, and best practices for writing papers.

Giving talks is the other primary way science is communicated—see [here](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_giving_talks/blob/master/thoughts_on_giving_talks.md) for my thoughts on giving engaging, thoughtful talks.

### graphics
I spend a lot of time thinking about color schemes and how best to present data so that information is communicated clearly and efficiently. [Here’s](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_graphics/blob/master/color_palettes.nb.html?raw=true) a collection of color schemes to think about and [here’s](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_graphics/blob/master/thoughts_on_graphs_and_graphics.md) the main document I use to document my thinking about graphics (with a focus on using R).

### book notes

I try and read a lot of books. I've been trying to get in the habit of taking [notes](https://github.com/lukereding/book_notes) and throwing them on GitHub.

### teaching
I document some methods for effective teaching [here](https://github.com/lukereding/teaching/blob/master/best_practices.md).
