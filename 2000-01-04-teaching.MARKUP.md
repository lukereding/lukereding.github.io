I've TA'ed introduction to ecology and evolution at UT for three semesters. I use of a lot of different techniques in my teaching and each time I TA a course I approach it armed with the experience of the previous semester.

I use a variety of approaches in my teaching:

* __grouping dissimilar students.__ I distribute a survey at the beginning of the class to get a feel for each student's personality and strengths. I use their responses to make groups with different types of people: business majors are paired with biology majors, students confident in their mastery of the material are paired with those whose understanding is shakey, native English speakers are paired with those for which English is a second language. The result is balanced groups in which students can learn from one another.

* __mid-semester evaluations.__ I ask students to fill out evaluations halfway through the semester so I know if there are major things I need to change about my teaching styles and how I meet students' needs.

* __one thing you didn't understand.__ One thing I plan to do in the future is to have each student write down one idea or concept they're still a little shakey on at the end of each class. These anonymous submissions have worked for other teachers in identifying concepts that need to be reviewed at the beginning of the next class.

* __problem sets.__ I distribute lengthy, ungraded problem sets before exams so that students can test their mastery of the material

* __weekly quizzes.__ I use weekly quizzes to ensure that students are keeping up with the material.
