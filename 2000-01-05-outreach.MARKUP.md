### gk-12 program

I've been fortunate enough to participate in the GK-12 program at UT. This goal of this program is to facilitate communication between university researchers and K-12 teachers and students. I've gotten to teach 4th and 5th grade girls about the properties of light, I've donned a 13-foot dinosaur to help kids imagine what life on Earth used to be like, and I've been able to judge numerous science fairs in the Austin area.

### mentoring high school students

This past year I've had the opportunity to mentor a high school student from a local Austin high school. With my and another graduate student's help, she was able to form a question on her own and design an experiment to test it. Next year I'm excited to be involved in the same program.

### mentoring undergraduates

I've also been lucky to mentor undergraduates--seven during my time here at UT so far. Some have gone on to graduate school and have completed REU programs at other universities.
