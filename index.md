I'm a graduate student and NSF Research Fellow in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate group](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) at UT Austin. I work with [Molly Cummings](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/cummingslab/).

__I study how organisms make decisions that are essential to their survival and reproduction.__

You can check out my CV [here](../files/cv.pdf) or learn more about me using the sidebar to the left. I also have a data analysis / visualization blog, [nonstandard deviations](https://lukereding.github.io/nonstandard_deviations/).
