I'm a graduate student, [NSF Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org), and [TVL Associate](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/Texas-Venture-Labs) in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior graduate group](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) at UT Austin. I work with [Molly Cummings](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/cummingslab/). 

I use computational tools to study how organisms make decisions that are essential to their survival and reproduction.

My interests include statistics, data analysis, data visualization, and programming (especially R, Python, and most recently Scala).

You can find my blog on data analysis, mining, and visualization projects [here](https://lukereding.github.io/nonstandard_deviations/).
