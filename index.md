I'm a graduate student and NSF Research Fellow in the [Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior department](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/eeb-graduate-program) at UT Austin. I work with [Molly Cummings](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/cummingslab/).

I study how organisms make decisions that are essential to their survival and reproduction.
